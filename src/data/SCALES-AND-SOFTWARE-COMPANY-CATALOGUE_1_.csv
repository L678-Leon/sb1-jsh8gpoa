"DESCRIPTION"
"08   Scales & Software (K) Ltd provides an automated solution that enables products such as milk to be"
"weighed at the factory reception area, issue receipts and upload the weighments to a back-end software"
"or ERP. This software software is called SMARTWEIGH."
"COMPONENTS"
"1.A receiving tank."
"2.A ﬂoor scale."
"3.An Indicator"
"4.A computer (Either Desktop or Laptop)"
"5.Smartweigh Software."
"HOW IT WORKS"
"The receiving tank is fabricated and ﬁtted on top of a ﬂoor scale which is already ﬁtted with a loadcell. The"
"scale is then connected to the indicator which will display the weight of the product being weighed. The"
"indicator is then in-turn connected to the computer where the Smartweigh software is already pre-"
"installed. Once the product has been placed in the receiving tank, the weight is displayed on the indicator"
"and automatically also displayed in the Smartweigh software. Once the weight has been accepted and"
"recorded, a receipt is issued to the supplier/farmer. The weighment data stored can then be uploaded to"
"a secondary system e.g an ERP."
